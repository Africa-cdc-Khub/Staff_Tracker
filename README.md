Africa CDC CBP (Central Business Platform)  - Africa CDC Staff Portal & Matrix Approval Management System

The Africa CDC Staff Tracker is a centralized platform designed to manage staff information, monitor task progress, and streamline approvals across divisions. It enables efficient performance tracking, leave management, and weekly activity planning to support organizational goals.

Integrated with the Matrix Approval Management module, the system ensures structured oversight of planned activities and budget allocations. Division focal persons can submit quarterly matrices outlining key deliverables, which then follow a defined multi-level approval workflow involving directors and senior management.

This system enhances transparency, accountability, and timely decision-making across Africa CDCâ€™s internal operations.
